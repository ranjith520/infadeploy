I am trying to achieve an automated way of deploying the Informatica Deployment by copying the deployment group from Source to target repository. 

Idea 

Create an HTML webpage Page 
Page will have Selection for   "Source Repository”
                                	"Target Repository”
                               	 "Deployment Group Name from Source Repository”
                              	 "Text box for Deployment Description (Comments in to Versioned Object)"
Tools Used:
Informatica
Shell Scripts
Java/HTML/CSS/Python or PHP

Please Help As Much as you can.
